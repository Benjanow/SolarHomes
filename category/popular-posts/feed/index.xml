				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-power-in-south-africa"> Solar Power and Solar Irradiation in South Africa</a></h1>
<p>South Africa has been a little slow to begin developing its potential for solar power generation, but solar power is now beginning to increase in importance in this country’s economy and electricity supply strategy.  One of the major inhibiting factors was the high initial cost of setting up a solar power system.  However, as the technology has improved and become cheaper, and as the supply of fossil fuel-based electricity has begun to fail to meet demand, leading to both power outages and sharp increases in electricity rates, <strong>solar power is fast gaining in popularity</strong>, and there are now several suppliers of the technology here.</p>
<p>In the last decade a team of South African scientists, led by Professor Vivian Alberts from the University of Johannesburg, developed a revolutionary new technology known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/photovoltaic-solar-panel-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thin Film Solar Technology</a> (TFST), which uses a metal alloy and is <strong>cheaper, thinner and more efficient</strong> than the standard silicone technology used.  Although it is not yet as widely available as the silicone solar panels in South Africa, it is being produced in bulk in Germany, and will soon become cheaper and easier to get in this country. New regulations are now coming into place stipulating that most new buildings should incorporate solar water heating, and should be as energy efficient as possible and reduce their dependence on non-renewable energy, and this will encourage the spread of solar power in the country.</p>
<p>There has been much controversy over the renewable energy policies of the national electricity provider, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/http://www.eskom.co.za/live/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eskom</a>.  The parastatal has recently taken the controversial decision to decrease feed-in tariffs (the money that is paid to electricity producers who supply electricity to the grid from renewable sources) which means that there will be less incentive for people to produce electricity for the grid.  However, it will also mean that energy from renewable sources will be cheaper, and since the price of fossil fuel-based electricity is increasing dramatically in South Africa, renewable energy may be cheaper than non-renewable within the next few years.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/stories/annual-solar-irradiation-south-africa.jpg" alt="Solar irradiation map of South Africa" data-lazy-loaded="true" />South Africa has an <strong>extremely high potential for solar power generation</strong>, since the majority of the country receives large amounts of sunshine all year round as depicted in the map to the left. Individual buildings, incorporating the latest technology, could supply the majority of their energy requirements through solar panels and solar water heaters mounted on their roofs and walls, and some may even be able to produce surplus electricity at times, which could be sold back to the grid. South Africa also has many suitable large open areas where concentrating solar power plants (huge arrays of solar panels) could be built to generate electricity for the grid. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/Additional%20-%20TP%20Fluri%20The%20potential%20of%20concentrating%20solar%20power%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper from the University of Stellenbosch</a>, South Africa has the potential to produce almost <strong>550GW</strong> of electricity through such plants, which could be located in specific parts of the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape and the Free State. The location of such plants depends on many factors, including the amount of sunshine received, the conservation status of the local vegetation, current land-use, topography (slope), water supply and the proximity of transmission lines. At this stage, the government has announced plans to build one huge plant in the Northern Cape – it will be the biggest one in the world – which will produce 5GW, a tenth of the country’s requirements.</p>
<p>The benefits of using solar power are clear. Once the initial costs of setting up a solar power system have been defrayed, households and businesses using solar power will save significant amounts of money by not buying electricity from the grid, and may even be able to make some money by selling any surplus back to the grid.  Using solar power also reduces the user’s carbon footprint by reducing the amount of fossil fuel that needs to be combusted in order to satisfy their energy needs.  Furthermore, it reduces the user’s dependence on electricity from the grid, which is set to become less and less reliable and more expensive as the demand for electricity in South Africa increases, and global fossil fuel prices also climb as the supply of fossil fuel dwindles.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="item1">How soon can I pay back my Green Power solar water heating system through my electricity savings?</h3>
<p>Every client is unique with different energy consumption habits and water usage. Eskom claims that your water geyser consumes about 40 to 60% of your monthly energy bill.</p>
<p>From our experience, if your monthly electricity bill is R600 per month and electricity tariffs continue to rise by 15% per annum, you should pay back a 150L system in less than 5 years through accumulated savings.</p>
<h3 id="item2">What happens if the weather is very bad?</h3>
<p>Vacuum tube solar water heating is the leader in solar heating technology, operating very effectively even in cloudy and overcast conditions. Vacuum tubes use the light radiation from the sun. For e.g. if you go to the beach and it’s overcast you still burn, the same principle applies with the vacuum tube. If the weather is constantly “bad” there are electric backup elements installed in your geyser for those rare “weeks of continuous rain and poor weather”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="item3">How hot does the water get in a solar geyser?</h3>
<p>This is dependent on the amount of light UVA/UVB radiation but the water can reach temperatures of up to 97o C in summer &amp; 70o C in winter.</p>
<h3 id="item4">Can I retrofit a Green Power Solar Water heating solution to my existing geyser?</h3>
<p>Yes. There are various valves and fittings on the market to retrofit your existing geyser.</p>
<h3 id="item5">What happens when the power goes off?</h3>
<p>Nothing. The water gets heated in the panel and as it’s heated, the water pressure increases and pushes the hot water through to the geyser. Additional expansion from the hot water will be relieved by the pressure release valve (PRV). Green Power has researched other alternatives like battery back-up systems and also small PV panels to run the pump and controller. Both options are available on request.</p>
<h3 id="item6">Why do I need a pump and controller?</h3>
<p>The controller is there for safety and efficiency and has built in safety features. For example if the water in your geyser reaches 90 degrees it shuts down the pump and stops more water from being unnecessarily heated. Once the geyser temperature drops, the panel and pump will run again and the water will be heated again.</p>
<p>In the case of freezing or if the panels’ temperature drops below 2 degrees the system will intelligently pump water through the panel to ensure the pipes don’t freeze up.</p>
<p>Efficiency- the Green Power system works on a temperature differential i.e. if the panel is hotter than the geyser it tells the pump to kick over a cycle of water and vice versa. The water then heats up and returns to the geyser, and the process starts all over again. The pump does not run continuously but rather heats the water up in cycles, making the system run not only efficiently, but cleverly too.</p>
<h3 id="item7">How does a vacuum tube heat the water?</h3>
<p>A vacuum in its very basic form is merely a natural insulator, providing for a heat-loss factor of merely 7%. In other words 93% of the radiation that enters the glass tube is retained and transferred to the water. The vacuum (similar to our ozone layer) assists in prevention of radiation and convection. Another example is a flask that you put your coffee in to keep warm. The vacuum tubes use the same principle except they keep the sun’s radiation in.</p>
<h3 id="item8">How do you install a solar geyser?</h3>
<p>Solar elements can be installed on the face of any North-facing wall or preferably on the roof. Water is pumped from the ordinary 3-port internal geyser, in circulation, over the solar element and returned to the internal geyser. Tiled or corrugated roofs work fine, while flat concrete roofs are ideal. The system is mounted onto the roof with each leg bolted to the beams within. Water proofing by means of flashing and sealants is accomplished relatively easily, because the panels are relatively light.</p>
<h3 id="item9">Do the glass tubes break very easily?</h3>
<p>According to South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) testing, the vacuum tubes resist hail up to 35mm in diameter. This is the largest hailstone that the SABS tests with! They might break as often as the windows in your home i.e. not very often! Should a vacuum tube break, the system continues to operate without interruption. An optional polycarbonate cover can be installed in heavy hail regions or where baboons are in the area. Replacement of a vacuum tube costs roughly R 220.00.</p>
<h3 id="item10">Can the solar geysers handle urban water pressure?</h3>
<p>Yes! Up to 400 kPa (4 Bar).</p>
<h3 id="item11">What is a 3-port geyser?</h3>
<p>Most geysers currently manufactured by ordinary geyser manufacturers have three ports. One port is taken up by the temperature/pressure (T/P) safety valve and cannot be used thereafter. Solar water heating systems require the geyser to have one additional water outlet to allow them to be easily coupled together. This makes a 4-port geyser. The Cobra geyser solves the problem by way of a Banjo type t/p safety valve which also acts as an outlet.</p>
<h3 id="item12">Why is vacuum tube technology more suited to moderate climes like the coast as opposed to flat plate technology?</h3>
<p>Flat plate collectors are susceptible to “wind Chill” which affects their efficiency. In addition to this, flat plate collectors are only efficient at solar noon when the sun is perpendicular to the collector. In contrast vacuum tubes are round, and all panels are installed with a reflector which enables them to track the sun, focusing all light on to the copper tube within the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>As well as this, vacuum tube technology is much less expensive in terms of maintenance and repair.</p>
<h3 id="item13">What is Eskom’s involvement in the solar water heating programme?</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the growing demand for electricity, Eskom is embarking on energy efficiency and alternative energy programmes that promote energy savings on a large scale in order to mitigate system constraints. Eskom is working towards a goal to meet government’s target of 10 000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy generation by 2013.</p>
<h3 id="item14">How does the programme work?</h3>
<p>The programme is structured around a rebate which reduces the selling price of a SABS approved solar water heating system. The reduction in price is based primarily on the performance of the solar water heater and its associated electricity saving potential. You receive a rebate directly from Deloittes, the facilitating auditors of the programme.</p>
<p>Only registered products, complying with the following criteria, qualify for the rebate:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>It must be a high-pressure system with pressure higher than 100kPa.</li>
<li>The system must have a timer to optimise energy savings and regulate everyday usage. Alternatively, a load management device, i.e. a geyser buddy or ripple relay, to control the usage in crisis situations must be installed.</li>
<li>The system must be appropriate for the household and area in which it is installed, in terms of size, frost protection and water quality compatibility.</li>
<li>It must have a comprehensive guarantee of at least five years.</li>
<li>The system must have passed the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) tests, and comply with the South African National Standards (SANS) for thermal and mechanical performance and safety.</li>
<li>The supplier of the system must be registered with SESSA (Sustainable Energy Society of South Africa) solar water heating division.</li>
<li>The system must be installed by a registered installer and the customer will only be able to claim the rebate once facilitating auditors receive a final invoice from their supplier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="item15">How do I ensure the quality of the system I have purchased?</h3>
<p>Purchasing a system that is registered on the Eskom programme ensures that the system and the supplier have been checked and audited, not only safeguarding you as a consumer but also giving you greater assurance of the system’s quality. Buying an Eskom registered system means you qualify for a rebate, making your purchase good value for money.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/home-solar-power-systems"> Solar Power Systems for your Home</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/home%20solar%20panel%20system%20diagram.jpg" alt="home solar panel system" border="0" data-lazy-loaded="true" />Many people believe that home solar power systems will eventually replace fossil-fuel based energy sources as the way that most people power their homes. This free and never-ending way to create energy is a much better way to create power for your home, and is more affordable than ever.</p>
<p>So, what is the most important thing that you should know about home solar power systems?</p>
<p>Did you know that the amount of energy that is absorbed into the earth, ocean and atmosphere every hour is more than the entire amount of energy that mankind used in the entire year of 2002. That’s what MIT’s publication “Powering the Planet: Chemical Challenges in Solar Energy Utilization” states. The earth absorbs energy from the sun in the form of heat and light, and the advent of home solar power systems means that the average citizen and homeowner can now put that energy to use!</p>
<p>That said, the most important thing you need to know about home solar power systems is that you can continue making electricity as long as the sun keeps on shining. Even if everyone had one of these amazing systems, you wouldn’t run out of energy. These systems are now available to homeowners in the form of photovoltaic solar cells, which convert sun energy into electricity and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-geyser-faq">solar geysers</a> that transfer the sun’s energy directly to water, making it hot enough for ordinary home use. The solar cells that most people use for their home solar power systems are arranged into a solar panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar panels need to be installed in different ways according to the area in which they are located. Placing solar panels in an area where they will get the most sun exposure and angling them so that they get the best exposure will allow you to get the most energy from them. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimum orientation of solar panels</a> depends on which hemisphere you are in and on the season of the year.</p>
<p>Solar powered systems can both heat the home and provide electricity for the home. You can even use them to heat your swimming pool!</p>
<p>Solar Panels have so many advantages, and so few disadvantages. Using any other sources of energy will seem like a poor choice. Here are the main advantages and disadvantages of solar power:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Solar Energy</strong></p>
<p>Saves you money</p>
<ul>
<li>After recouping the initial investment the energy is practically free.</li>
<li>The payback period will be shorter the more energy you use.</li>
<li>If you produce more energy than you use your utility company can buy the extra electricity from you, this is called net metering.</li>
<li>Solar enery is not affected by the supply and demand for oil and therefore not subject to the ever increasing price of petrol.</li>
<li>The saving will last for many years as solar panels are very durable and have a long lifespan of 20 – 30 years.</li>
<li>Solar energy indirectly reduces health costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmentally friendly</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar energy is clean, renewable (unlike gas, oil and coal) and sustainable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Solar panels do not release carbon dioxide or other gases into the air.</li>
<li>Actively contributes to the decrease of green house emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independant/semi-independant</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be utilized to offset utility-supplied energy consumption.</li>
<li>Can operate entirely independent, not requiring a connection to a power or gas grid at all.</li>
<li>Solar Energy supports local job and wealth creation, fuelling local economies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low maintenance</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar energy systems are virtually maintenance free and will last for decades.</li>
<li>Once installed, there are no recurring costs.</li>
<li>They operate silently, have no moving parts, do not release offensive smells and do not require you to add any fuel.</li>
<li>More solar panels can easily be added in the future when your family’s needs grow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Solar Energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The initial cost is the main disadvantage of installing a solar energy system.</li>
<li>The cost is still higher than utility supplied electricity but as fosil feul preices rise it is becoming more competitive.</li>
<li>Solar panels require quite a large area for installation to achieve a good level of efficiency.</li>
<li>The production of solar energy is influenced by the presence of clouds or pollution in the air.</li>
<li>No solar energy is produced at night but this problem can is solved by using batteries.</li>
<li>As far as solar powered cars go – their slower speed might not appeal to everyone caught up in today’s rat race.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, why haven’t more people been using solar systems? Especially now, in a world where our climate is rapidly changing, and our environment is more polluted than ever, and fossil fuels are starting to cost an arm and a leg?</p>
<p>Most people are nervous about not getting enough sunshine. If the sun’s not out, then the solar panels can’t collect energy. It’s not always sunny. And, even though fossil fuels have gotten a lot more expensive in recent years, these fuels are still less expensive than solar power.</p>
<p>And last of all, if you do live in a very sunny area, then you might even be able to use your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/http://www.alternative-energy-geek.com/why-is-solar-energy-important.html">home solar power</a> systems to make excess energy, which you can then sell back to your power company since you won’t be able to use it.</p>
<p>Every day, the benefits of solar power systems for the home are getting more and more obvious. Our society is becoming more and more energy conscious. Even though fossil fuels are still available, solar power is available as long as the sun is out, and the production of it cannot be controlled by companies or the government.</p>
<p>Solar power systems for the home are an energy source that is environmentally friendly, and will eventually be less expensive as more people start wanting to use it. Whereas fossil fuels will only get more expensive so long as people continue buying it. These home systems can save you tons of money when it comes to conditioning your home’s air.</p>
<p>There are even tax breaks in a few states or countries for people who have such systems for their homes. These tax breaks alone can make it easier for you to afford a system for your home.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the amazing new solar technology available to you today by installing a solar power system in your home. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

Posted on November 13, 2017 by root<br />
Solar Panels For Sale In South Africa</p>
<p>This is a guide to the different types of solar panels and cells available in South Africa. A price list has also been provided.<br />
Types Of Solar Panels</p>
<p>Mono-crystalline Solar Panels</p>
<p>Mono-crystalline Solar Panels are very efficient, even in low-light conditions, because they are made of one large crystal of silicon. They are not common as they are more expensive than Poly-crystalline Solar Panels to manufacture. Mono-crystalline Solar Panels can be ground-mounted or roof-mounted.<br />
Poly-crystalline Solar Panels</p>
<p>Poly-crystalline Solar Panels are not quite as efficient as Mono-crystalline Solar Panels, but are the most common type because they are less expensive to manufacture. They are made of many small silicon crystals. Poly-crystalline Solar Panels can be ground-mounted or roof-mounted.<br />
Amorphous or Thin-Film Solar Panels</p>
<p>Amorphous Solar Panels are less efficient than the above two types, therefore they require a larger surface area for the same level of power generation. However they are the cheapest to manufacture. They are made of a thin film of molten silicon that is spread across large plates of stainless steel.</p>
<p>A great advantage of Amorphous Solar Panels over the above two is that they continue to charge when only part of the solar panel receives sun.</p>
<p>They work better in hot climates than traditional solar panels and work well on large vehicles and ships.</p>
<p>Mounting Of Solar Panels</p>
<p>Ground-Mounted Solar Panels</p>
<p>Ground mounted solar panels are attached to poles that should be cemented into the ground, especially if you live in a region that has strong wind.<br />
Roof-Mounted Solar Panels</p>
<p>It is easiest to install roof-mounted solar panels on a shingle roof, though it is possible on many different types of roof.<br />
Glued To The Surface</p>
<p>Thin-film Solar Panels require no drilling as they are glued onto the roof or other flat surface, e.g. on ships. You might also consider Thin-film Solar Panels if the strength of the roof is suspect, because they are much lighter than the other types of solar panels.</p>
<p>Factors To Consider When Choosing Solar Panels</p>
<p>Roof-mounted solar panels are an option in the case of a strong roof that slopes towards the sun. Roof-mounting is possible on many types of roof, but easiest on shingle roofs. If you have weak roof, look at ground-mounting your panels or apply thin-film panels. If the roof does not face the sun you will have to look at ground-mounting your solar panels.</p>
<p>If do not wish to drill holes in your roof, then you will have to go for Ground-mounted solar panels or Thin-film Solar Panels. Thin-film solar panels need a larger roof area for the same output.</p>
<p>For an easy installation, choose Thin-film Solar Panels because they are simply glued onto the roof. The other types are not difficult to install, but do require more effort than simply gluing. The technically-minded person can do a DIY installation.</p>
<p>Here is a table to help you choose the correct type of solar panel for your situation:<br />
Strong Roof Weak Roof Large Roof Roof Not Facing The Sun Not Willing To Drill Through The Roof Limited Direct Sun Easy Installation<br />
Ground-Mounted N/A Yes N/A Yes Yes<br />
Roof-Mounted Yes No Yes No No<br />
Glued (Thin-Film) Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes<br />
What Do Solar Panels Cost?</p>
<p>There is a wide range of solar power panels at various prices and some suppliers offer regular discounts to encourage you to make the decision to buy.</p>
<p>You can expect to pay about R24 per watt for Poly-crystalline Solar Panels.</p>
<p>Solaire’s Poly-crystalline Solar Panels are believed to be the most efficient modules in the world, meaning that they provide the highest number of watts per square metre (Wp/sqm). High yield modules output at least 130 Wp/sqm in a prime position. Solaire has captured 90% of the Solar Panel world market and their panels have a life expectancy of over 30 years.</p>
<p>Thin-film Solar Panels produce about 74 Wp/sqm (peak power).</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what solar panels cost, I have included the prices of Solaire Poly-Crystalline Solar Panels from www.sustainable.co.za Check for price changes on their site.<br />
Short On Roof Space?</p>
<p>If you are critically short on roof space, you should look at the “Peak Power In Watts Per Sqm” column in this table. This suggests that you should avoid the solar panels with a low Power Per Square Metre Figure (shown in red) and buy the solar panels with a high figure (shown in green). Of course, you would also have to consider the how many panels are required to make up the required voltage.</p>
<p>After investigation you may find a similar anomaly with the solar panels of other manufacturers.<br />

Types of Solar Panel<br />
Posted on November 13, 2017 by root<br />
Solar Panels: Different Types, Electricity Storage and Cost<br />
Types of electric solar panels</p>
<p>Solar panels are made up of varying numbers of solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, which convert the sun’s energy into storable electricity by means of semiconductors, using the photovoltaic effect.  These solar panels are generally called photovoltaic (PV) panels as opposed to thermal solar panels that produce hot water. Various different types of photovoltaic solar panels are available, the most common of which are rigid, and are known as crystalline silicon, either monocrystalline or multicrystalline.  A more recent development is thin-film solar panels, which can be either rigid or flexible.  They are typically more efficient, in other words they produce more electricity for the same amount of sunshine and area of solar panel, but at present they cost more than crystalline silicon panels in South Africa.  Various sizes of solar panels are available, so when buying them it is best to work out the approximate amount of electricity required and choose the size accordingly.<br />

<p>Electricity storage (Batteries)</p>
<p>The electricity produced during the day, if not used immediately, is stored in rechargeable batteries for use when the panel is not producing electricity, such as at night or during heavily overcast weather.  The batteries used depend on requirements; it is important to calculate maximum charge and discharge rates, as well as the quantity of electricity required, before selecting batteries.  The batteries most commonly used are of the lead-acid type.  Shallow cycle lead-acid batteries, such as those used in cars, are not recommended for solar power systems, since they do not tolerate repeated heavy discharging, and are quickly damaged in these conditions.  There are several types of deep cycle batteries, such as flooded, gel and absorbed glass mat (AGM).  Each of these has different advantages and disadvantages, such as durability and lifespan, the level of maintenance required, whether or not they produce gas during operation, and of course price.<br />
Prices of solar panels in South Africa</p>
<p>The price of solar panels in South Africa depends very much on the amount of electricity required, the type and make of panel, and various other factors such as how the panel is to be mounted or integrated into a building.  Some stockists display prices online while others only provide quotes on request.  For an idea of prices in South Africa, Sustainable.co.za, which regularly features special offers and discounts and sells a wide range of sizes and types of panels, is selling their smallest rigid panel (10W) for R350 (prices correct as of 9 February 2011).  Their biggest rigid panel (250W) costs R8 850, and their biggest flexible solar panel (136W), which is recommended for camping, costs R9 990.  A full camping kit including the latter panel and all necessary peripherals costs R12 340.  They also sell rigid panel kits, including batteries, a charge controller, which protects the batteries from over charging and excessive discharging, and an inverter, which converts the DC power stored in the batteries to AC power.  A kit containing a 120W panel costs around R9 250, while a kit that would produce 1kWh per day costs about R12 500.<br />
Where to get solar panels in South Africa</p>
<p>There are now several suppliers of solar panels in South Africa.  Among them are Sustainable.co.za, K G Electric, Sinetech, GW Store, Safrelec, The Solar Company and Gener8.  They generally import their products from overseas (although some may be assembled in South Africa), and offer a range of sustainable energy solutions, including all the peripherals required.  Most of them offer the option of DIY installation or their own installation service.  The amount of information available on their websites varies from site to site, as does the range of products they offer.  Some, such as Safrelec, may be acting more as wholesalers than retailers, geared for the construction industry rather than individual customers.  Their web addresses and more info can be found under Solar Power Companies.<br />

<p class="articleinfo"><span class="createdby"> Written by Tony Clark </span></p>
<p>If you are not connected to Mains (Grid) power, or the Mains power is unreliable, you may need to store power from your solar panels Solar PV system to use when the Mains is not available, or at night.</p>
<p>My Solar Power system has 2 separate systems. We have a Grid Connect Inverter for a 1KWp solar PV array and we have a Stand Alone power system, which comprises a 3.6KWp solar array, a MPPT battery charger, a large battery bank and an inverter to power our 240V appliances. I will include photographs of our system at a later date.</p>
<p>We have a power source selection switch to allow us to control the source of our 240V Power. We can either select Mains (Grid) power or we can select Inverter (Solar) power.</p>
<p>The switch also has an OFF position between these two sources.</p>
<p>Most of the time we use Solar PV power from the Inverter, but when we do not have adequate sunshine, or our usage is high, we select the Mains power source.</p>
<p><strong>This article concentrates on the different batteries available for Solar Power storage.</strong></p>
<h3>Batteries:</h3>
<p>There are 3 main types of batteries used for Solar PV Power storage;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead – Acid</li>
<li>Nickel Cadmium  (NiCd)</li>
<li>Nickel – Iron (NiFe)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery">Lead – Acid</a></h2>
<p>These are the most commonly used storage batteries for Solar PV Storage, due mainly to their relatively low price.</p>
<p>Lead – Acid batteries can have a long service life of between 15 and 25 years in Float applications and between 5 and 10 years in solar applications. Their “self-discharge is low at about 40% per annum. The lead in these batteries is recyclable, but lead is a toxic metal, so end of life recycling is important.</p>
<p>There are 3 technologies available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vented (Flooded) Cells – These have liquid electrolyte in them. This then has the risk of leakage or spills from the battery. Vented cells are suitable for use in high temperature locations, and in Solar applications have additional electrolyte capacity to cater for regular (automatic) equalisation charges. They also require regular maintenance (checking electrolyte levels, cleaning terminals, recording cell voltage and Specific Gravity.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery#Gel_battery">Gel Cells (Sealed Lead Acid &#8211; SLA)</a> – These overcome the risks of electrolyte leakage by having the electrolyte in a gel form.  These batteries have a relatively long life and most manufacturers have overcome terminal corrosion issues. They are lighter than equivalent capacity vented cells. They batteries are suitable for moderately high temperature locations as there is adequate electrolyte.  Some manufacturers produce GEL cells specifically for Solar power applications. These batteries will have a maximum cell voltage specified by the manufacturer.  Operation above this voltage will cause excessive “gassing” and this may cause the pressure valve to vent pressure (gasses from the electrolyte) which will reduce the available electrolyte.  Regular maintenance should include measuring cell voltages and temperature.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery#Absorbed_glass_mat">AGM Cells (Sealed Lead Acid &#8211; SLA) </a> – These cells have an absorbent glass mat to hold the electrolyte. These are usually the cheapest type of Lead – Acid battery.  They are very light compared with Vented or Gel cells, as they do not have the large volume of electrolyte used in Vented or Gel cells. As there is little excess electrolyte operation in high temperature areas is not recommended.  These also have a maximum cell voltage specified and operation above this voltage will shorten battery life significantly.  These are not recommended for use in “charge / discharge” applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery_%28vented_cell_type%29#Sealed_vs._vented">Nickel Cadmium</a></h2>
<p>These have a long life but have a high initial cost and are not as efficient in storing power than Lead–Acid. Nickel – Cadmium (NiCd) batteries are available as vented or sealed varieties. They have a higher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy density</a> than Lead Acid batteries, are smaller, longer lived and have lower maintenance needs but they are less efficient (losing up to 40% of power in a charge / discharge cycle) and have a high self discharge rate (up to 120% per annum). At “end of life” these batteries must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner to prevent contamination of the environment with the Cadmium they contain.  NiCd battery disposal costs can be high. The high purchase price and high disposal cost are real disincentives to the use of NiCd cells in solar Systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://www.nickel-iron-battery.com/">Nickel Iron</a></h2>
<p>Nickel Iron batteries have the longest life of the 3 technologies discussed. They contain no environmentally damaging metals and perform well in deep cycle operation. They have a relatively high charge – discharge efficiency (approaching 100% at 50% Charged), but relatively low charge retention, losing 20% – 30% of capacity per month. The main disincentive to NiFe cell use in solar Systems, is the high purchase price.</p>

<p class="articleinfo"><span class="createdby"> Written by Simisha Pather-Elias </span> <span class="createdate"> Tuesday, 23 August 2011 21:14 </span></p>
<p>2011 has indeed been an interesting year for the renewable energy sector in the country. Electricity tariffs went up another 25% in July making all renewable energy technologies more attractive to the consumer, especially solar water heaters (SWHs); and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.energy.gov.za/IRP/irp%20files/IRP2010_2030_Final_Report_20110325.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated Resource Plan 2</a> (IRP2)<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> was finalized with big wins for the solar industry especially  for large scale solar PV. Following that, the government announced the reduction in rebates for solar water heaters and declared the feed-in tariff model (REFIT) to be illegal, sending renewable energy investors and developers scuttling.  With this rollercoaster chain of events, one ponders where the solar industry is going and whether it is the right time for companies to invest in South Africa.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, the major obstacle to advancement of the solar industry in South Africa, has always been the high cost of the technology. While international learning curves have reduced the cost of renewable energy technologies significantly, most technologies remain prohibitive unless there are incentives such as subsidies and rebates. This has been the case for solar water heaters and solar PV in particular.</p>
<h2>Solar Water Heaters</h2>
<p>The solar water heaters market has flourished with the number of suppliers increasing more than 20-fold in the last decade to approximately 400<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/press-release.pag?docid=226282192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>, 2011) – this in line with the government’s subsidy scheme for domestic users. Although the subsidy which has fulfilled its purpose to kick start the market is now coming to an end, the country’s target for 1 million solar by 2014 still remains. Furthermore, with electricity costs going up another 25% next year, the impending of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/including-solar-water-heaters-in-building-codes-to-help-sa-reach-2014-target-2011-06-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green building codes</a> for all buildings<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"></a>, and the possible pass over costs of the proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.polity.org.za/article/eskom-warns-it-will-pass-on-full-carbon-tax-effect-to-consumers-2011-06-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon taxes from Eskom to the consumer</a><a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"></a>, the solar water heaters used in households is forecasted to remain strong. A large growth spurt in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.reafrica.co.za/Images/Presentations%20Day%202/Dominic%20Goncalves.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solar water heater industry</a> from 2012 onwards until maturity in 2016 is expected<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"></a>.</p>
<p>Those companies which can secure their place in the market now, using quality products and workmanship will reap the benefits in the years to come. Government has also proposed subsidies for local manufacturers, an opportunity for South Africato become an exporter of green technologies.  What remains is knowledge dissemination and skills exchange to increase the number of technicians, especially plumbers and electricians who can install different types of solar water heaters to meet the projected demand.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/ewh%20market.jpg" alt="South Africa solar industry - Development, growth, maturity" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Solar PV (Photovoltaic)</h2>
<p>Following the solar water heater industry is solar PV, which although still very much in its infancy, is expected to explode beyond its current off-grid use which includes telecommunications, game farms and isolated lodges, rural applications and navigational buoys. While experimental road signage, street lights and billboard illumination has started to take off recently, the price of PV remains uneconomical and government support is largely needed to stimulate this market.</p>
<p>The IRP2 has a target of 8 400MW by 2030, with 300MW planned for installment annually from 2012 for large scale PV – a welcomed surprise considering the price of the solar modules.  While the current price of PV modules has decreased significantly, and the PV manufacturing industry continues to grow, even in the absence of the 5GW Upington Solar Project (comprising both Concentrated Solar Power and solar PV), the potential for an export orientated manufacturing hub in South Africais a key growth area. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?Src=RSS&amp;docid=232973392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report by Frost and Sullivan</a><a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> states that &#8220;several global leading manufacturers are currently expressing interest in developing large-scale manufacturing facilities in South Africa&#8221;, allowing South Africa to attain growth revenues of $29.8 million by 2014. When the plans for the solar park are confirmed, this will propel South Africa’s manufacturing hub even further. Other industries that will also clearly benefit are sales and distribution, and construction, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>It’s a very exciting time for the solar industry in South Africa. The opportunity of a green economy is exactly what South Africa requires to put itself into the forefront of the renewable energy sector, despite the prevailing globally failing markets and the unnerving global economic outlook.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195656/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/the-secret-of-affordable-solar-power-systems"> Affordable Solar Power Systems: The Secret that Can Save You a Large Portion of Your Electricity Bill</a></h1>
<p>Electricity prices are increasing exponentially, especially in South Africa where Eskom&#8217;s average annual price increase is 16% (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195656/http://www.eskom.co.za/tariffs">Eskom Tariffs</a>). Utility companies know that everybody needs power, electricity is a necessity for most people, and consumers will have to pay the prices they set. In South Africa Eskom has a monopoly on the power market, they can basically charge what they want.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t know this, but it is actually possible to generate power yourself for a fraction of the cost you pay for grid power. Solar energy can quite easily be harnessed to power your home safely and economically. This makes you independant from the national power grid, so you are immune to blackouts and load shedding while still being able to draw power from the grid if you need to.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking how is that possible when residential solar systems can cost R30,000 to R80,000 to install. Well the thing is you don&#8217;t need to buy solar panels and have them installed by someone else, the secret to affordable solar power systems is that you can make and install the solar panels yourself. You can <strong>build your own solar system </strong>from readily available parts. You can find out exactly how to do it with an expert guide created by an experienced electrician who was sick of depending on the power grid and decided to share his solution.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195656/http://0387fexngpucxl4q6jqjqo8k51.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Power4Home</a></strong> is a set of DVD&#8217;s and manuals explaining exactly how to do everything you need to know to build and install your own solar panels. The materials you will need cost about $200 or R1660. Of course it will take a few days of your time as well. The video says that anyone can do this but I think you do need some basic skills like knowing how to use electric drills, skrewdrivers, glue, saws and so on. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195656/http://0387fexngpucxl4q6jqjqo8k51.hop.clickbank.net/">video</a> says that thousands of people have sucessfully used this guide to convert their house to run on solar and cut their power bill to zero or even have the electric company pay them for extra power they produce.</p>
<p>The guide includes the following components that will be shipped to your house (shipping is free)</p>
<ul>
<li>DVD&#8217;s and manuals on how to build you own solar panels</li>
<li>How to install and wire up the system</li>
<li>How to build a wind generator</li>
<li>How to make batteries to store your power</li>
<li>Life time support</li>
</ul>
<p>The Power4Home guide costs $49.97 or R415 with a 60 day 100% money back guarantee.</p>
<p>See what John Russel, the electrician who created the Power4Home system has to say in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195656/http://0387fexngpucxl4q6jqjqo8k51.hop.clickbank.net/">this video</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/photovoltaic-solar-panel-types"> Photovoltaic Solar Panel Types and Technologies</a></h1>
<p>Most crystalline silicon technologies (Mono or Poly crystalline) yield similar results, with high durability and long life. Twenty-five-year warranties are common for crystalline silicon solar panels. Monocrystalline tends to be slightly smaller in size per watt of power output, and slightly more expensive than polycrystalline.</p>
<p>The construction of solar panels from crystalline silicon cells is generally the same, regardless of the technology. The most common construction is by laminating the cells between a tempered glass front and a plastic backing, using a clear adhesive. It is then framed with aluminium.</p>
<p>The silicon used to produce crystalline modules is derived from sand. It is the second most common element on earth, so why is it so expensive? The answer is that, in order to produce the photovoltaic effect, it must be purified to an extremely high degree. Such pure &#8220;semiconductor grade&#8221; silicon is very expensive to produce. It is also in high demand in the electronics industry because it is the base material for computer chips and other devices. Crystalline solar cells are about the thickness of a human fingernail. They use a relatively large amount of silicon.</p>
<h2>Monocrystalline Solar Panels</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocrystalline_silicon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monocrystalline</a> (Single Crystal) is the original PV technology invented in 1955. Monocrystalline solar panels are composed of cells cut from a continuous crystal. The silicon crystal forms as a cylinder, which is sliced into thin circular wafers. The cells may be circular or may be trimmed into square(ish) shapes, to minimise unused space on the solar panel. Because each cell is cut from a single crystal, it has a uniform dark blue colour. Monocrystalline solar cells can achieve an efficiency of up to 17%, but commercially available panels are usually around 14% &#8211; 16% efficient.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/monocrystalline-solar-cell.jpg" alt="Monocrystalline Solar Cell" /></p>
<h2>Polycrystalline Solar Panels</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrystalline_solar_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polycrystalline</a> (many crystals) cells were new to the market in 1981. They are similar in performance and reliability to Monocrystalline. Polycrystalline cells are made from a similar silicon material, but are melted and poured into a mould to form a square block that can be cut into square wafers with less waste of space or material than round single-crystal wafers. As the silicon cools, it crystallises, but forms random crystal boundaries. Their efficiency of energy conversion is slightly lower than Monocrystalline cells. This means that the size of a Polycrystalline solar panel is slightly greater per watt than most Monocrystalline solar panels. Polycrystalline cells look different to Monocrystalline solar cells.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/polycrystalline-solar-cells.jpg" alt="Polycrystalline Solar Cell" /></p>
<p>The surface has a random appearance with significant variations of the blue colour. Efficiencies of up to 16% are possible.</p>
<h2>Thin Film Solar Panels Aka Amorphous Solar Panels</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_film_solar_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thin Film</a> Solar Cells (also known as “amorphous”, meaning &#8220;not crystalline&#8221;) were first produced in 1976 These PV cells are made with microscopically thin deposit of silicon, instead of a thick wafer. This uses very little silicon. It is generally deposited on a sheet of metal, plastic or glass. The individual cells are deposited next to each other, instead of being assembled. The active material may be silicon, or it may be a more exotic material. Thin film panels can be made flexible and lightweight by using plastic glazing. Some flexible panels can tolerate a bullet hole without failing. Some of them perform slightly better than crystalline modules under low light conditions. They are also less susceptible to power loss from partial shading of a module.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140626im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/thin-film-solar-panel.jpg" alt="Thin Film Solar Panel" /></p>
<p>The disadvantages of thin film technology are lower efficiency (commercially available panels have efficiencies of ~9%) and uncertain durability. Lower efficiency means that more space and mounting hardware is required to produce the same power output. At this stage, thin film materials tend to be less stable than crystalline, causing degradation over time. We will be seeing many new thin film products introduced in the coming years, with efficiency and warranties that may approach those of crystalline silicon.</p>
<p>It is believed that crystalline silicon will remain the &#8220;premium&#8221; technology for critical applications in remote areas. Thin film will have strong growth in the &#8220;consumer&#8221; market where price is a critical factor, but this must be balanced against the additional collection area needed for the lower efficiency thin film panels and the likelihood of shorter operating life.</p>
<p>As usual, you get what you pay for.</p>

<h2>Types of electric solar panels</h2>
<p>Solar panels are made up of varying numbers of solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, which convert the sun&#8217;s energy into storable electricity by means of semiconductors, using the photovoltaic effect.  These solar panels are generally called photovoltaic (PV) panels as opposed to thermal solar panels that produce hot water. Various different types of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195045/http://www.photovoltaicsolarpanels.co.za/">photovoltaic solar panels</a> are available, the most common of which are rigid, and are known as crystalline silicon, either monocrystalline or multicrystalline.  A more recent development is thin-film solar panels, which can be either rigid or flexible.  They are typically more efficient, in other words they produce more electricity for the same amount of sunshine and area of solar panel, but at present they cost more than crystalline silicon panels in South Africa.  Various sizes of solar panels are available, so when buying them it is best to work out the approximate amount of electricity required and choose the size accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Electricity storage (Batteries)</h2>
<p>The electricity produced during the day, if not used immediately, is stored in rechargeable batteries for use when the panel is not producing electricity, such as at night or during heavily overcast weather.  The batteries used depend on requirements; it is important to calculate maximum charge and discharge rates, as well as the quantity of electricity required, before selecting batteries.  The batteries most commonly used are of the lead-acid type.  Shallow cycle lead-acid batteries, such as those used in cars, are not recommended for solar power systems, since they do not tolerate repeated heavy discharging, and are quickly damaged in these conditions.  There are several types of deep cycle batteries, such as flooded, gel and absorbed glass mat (AGM).  Each of these has different advantages and disadvantages, such as durability and lifespan, the level of maintenance required, whether or not they produce gas during operation, and of course price.</p>
<h2>Prices of solar panels in South Africa</h2>
<p>The price of solar panels in South Africa depends very much on the amount of electricity required, the type and make of panel, and various other factors such as how the panel is to be mounted or integrated into a building.  Some stockists display prices online while others only provide quotes on request.  For an idea of prices in South Africa, Sustainable.co.za, which regularly features special offers and discounts and sells a wide range of sizes and types of panels, is selling their smallest rigid panel (10W) for R350 (prices correct as of 9 February 2011).  Their biggest rigid panel (250W) costs R8 850, and their biggest flexible solar panel (136W), which is recommended for camping, costs R9 990.  A full camping kit including the latter panel and all necessary peripherals costs R12 340.  They also sell rigid panel kits, including batteries, a charge controller, which protects the batteries from over charging and excessive discharging, and an inverter, which converts the DC power stored in the batteries to AC power.  A kit containing a 120W panel costs around R9 250, while a kit that would produce 1kWh per day costs about R12 500.</p>
<h2>Where to get solar panels in South Africa</h2>
<p>There are now several suppliers of solar panels in South Africa.  Among them are Sustainable.co.za, K G Electric, Sinetech, GW Store, Safrelec, The Solar Company and Gener8.  They generally import their products from overseas (although some may be assembled in South Africa), and offer a range of sustainable energy solutions, including all the peripherals required.  Most of them offer the option of DIY installation or their own installation service.  The amount of information available on their websites varies from site to site, as does the range of products they offer.  Some, such as Safrelec, may be acting more as wholesalers than retailers, geared for the construction industry rather than individual customers.  Their web addresses and more info can be found under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195045/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-power-companies">Solar Power Companies</a>.</p>
