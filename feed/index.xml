				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-power-in-south-africa"> Solar Power and Solar Irradiation in South Africa</a></h1>
<p>South Africa has been a little slow to begin developing its potential for solar power generation, but solar power is now beginning to increase in importance in this country’s economy and electricity supply strategy.  One of the major inhibiting factors was the high initial cost of setting up a solar power system.  However, as the technology has improved and become cheaper, and as the supply of fossil fuel-based electricity has begun to fail to meet demand, leading to both power outages and sharp increases in electricity rates, <strong>solar power is fast gaining in popularity</strong>, and there are now several suppliers of the technology here.</p>
<p>In the last decade a team of South African scientists, led by Professor Vivian Alberts from the University of Johannesburg, developed a revolutionary new technology known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/photovoltaic-solar-panel-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thin Film Solar Technology</a> (TFST), which uses a metal alloy and is <strong>cheaper, thinner and more efficient</strong> than the standard silicone technology used.  Although it is not yet as widely available as the silicone solar panels in South Africa, it is being produced in bulk in Germany, and will soon become cheaper and easier to get in this country. New regulations are now coming into place stipulating that most new buildings should incorporate solar water heating, and should be as energy efficient as possible and reduce their dependence on non-renewable energy, and this will encourage the spread of solar power in the country.</p>
<p>There has been much controversy over the renewable energy policies of the national electricity provider, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/http://www.eskom.co.za/live/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eskom</a>.  The parastatal has recently taken the controversial decision to decrease feed-in tariffs (the money that is paid to electricity producers who supply electricity to the grid from renewable sources) which means that there will be less incentive for people to produce electricity for the grid.  However, it will also mean that energy from renewable sources will be cheaper, and since the price of fossil fuel-based electricity is increasing dramatically in South Africa, renewable energy may be cheaper than non-renewable within the next few years.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/stories/annual-solar-irradiation-south-africa.jpg" alt="Solar irradiation map of South Africa" data-lazy-loaded="true" />South Africa has an <strong>extremely high potential for solar power generation</strong>, since the majority of the country receives large amounts of sunshine all year round as depicted in the map to the left. Individual buildings, incorporating the latest technology, could supply the majority of their energy requirements through solar panels and solar water heaters mounted on their roofs and walls, and some may even be able to produce surplus electricity at times, which could be sold back to the grid. South Africa also has many suitable large open areas where concentrating solar power plants (huge arrays of solar panels) could be built to generate electricity for the grid. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135152/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/Additional%20-%20TP%20Fluri%20The%20potential%20of%20concentrating%20solar%20power%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper from the University of Stellenbosch</a>, South Africa has the potential to produce almost <strong>550GW</strong> of electricity through such plants, which could be located in specific parts of the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape and the Free State. The location of such plants depends on many factors, including the amount of sunshine received, the conservation status of the local vegetation, current land-use, topography (slope), water supply and the proximity of transmission lines. At this stage, the government has announced plans to build one huge plant in the Northern Cape – it will be the biggest one in the world – which will produce 5GW, a tenth of the country’s requirements.</p>
<p>The benefits of using solar power are clear. Once the initial costs of setting up a solar power system have been defrayed, households and businesses using solar power will save significant amounts of money by not buying electricity from the grid, and may even be able to make some money by selling any surplus back to the grid.  Using solar power also reduces the user’s carbon footprint by reducing the amount of fossil fuel that needs to be combusted in order to satisfy their energy needs.  Furthermore, it reduces the user’s dependence on electricity from the grid, which is set to become less and less reliable and more expensive as the demand for electricity in South Africa increases, and global fossil fuel prices also climb as the supply of fossil fuel dwindles.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="item1">How soon can I pay back my Green Power solar water heating system through my electricity savings?</h3>
<p>Every client is unique with different energy consumption habits and water usage. Eskom claims that your water geyser consumes about 40 to 60% of your monthly energy bill.</p>
<p>From our experience, if your monthly electricity bill is R600 per month and electricity tariffs continue to rise by 15% per annum, you should pay back a 150L system in less than 5 years through accumulated savings.</p>
<h3 id="item2">What happens if the weather is very bad?</h3>
<p>Vacuum tube solar water heating is the leader in solar heating technology, operating very effectively even in cloudy and overcast conditions. Vacuum tubes use the light radiation from the sun. For e.g. if you go to the beach and it’s overcast you still burn, the same principle applies with the vacuum tube. If the weather is constantly “bad” there are electric backup elements installed in your geyser for those rare “weeks of continuous rain and poor weather”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="item3">How hot does the water get in a solar geyser?</h3>
<p>This is dependent on the amount of light UVA/UVB radiation but the water can reach temperatures of up to 97o C in summer &amp; 70o C in winter.</p>
<h3 id="item4">Can I retrofit a Green Power Solar Water heating solution to my existing geyser?</h3>
<p>Yes. There are various valves and fittings on the market to retrofit your existing geyser.</p>
<h3 id="item5">What happens when the power goes off?</h3>
<p>Nothing. The water gets heated in the panel and as it’s heated, the water pressure increases and pushes the hot water through to the geyser. Additional expansion from the hot water will be relieved by the pressure release valve (PRV). Green Power has researched other alternatives like battery back-up systems and also small PV panels to run the pump and controller. Both options are available on request.</p>
<h3 id="item6">Why do I need a pump and controller?</h3>
<p>The controller is there for safety and efficiency and has built in safety features. For example if the water in your geyser reaches 90 degrees it shuts down the pump and stops more water from being unnecessarily heated. Once the geyser temperature drops, the panel and pump will run again and the water will be heated again.</p>
<p>In the case of freezing or if the panels’ temperature drops below 2 degrees the system will intelligently pump water through the panel to ensure the pipes don’t freeze up.</p>
<p>Efficiency- the Green Power system works on a temperature differential i.e. if the panel is hotter than the geyser it tells the pump to kick over a cycle of water and vice versa. The water then heats up and returns to the geyser, and the process starts all over again. The pump does not run continuously but rather heats the water up in cycles, making the system run not only efficiently, but cleverly too.</p>
<h3 id="item7">How does a vacuum tube heat the water?</h3>
<p>A vacuum in its very basic form is merely a natural insulator, providing for a heat-loss factor of merely 7%. In other words 93% of the radiation that enters the glass tube is retained and transferred to the water. The vacuum (similar to our ozone layer) assists in prevention of radiation and convection. Another example is a flask that you put your coffee in to keep warm. The vacuum tubes use the same principle except they keep the sun’s radiation in.</p>
<h3 id="item8">How do you install a solar geyser?</h3>
<p>Solar elements can be installed on the face of any North-facing wall or preferably on the roof. Water is pumped from the ordinary 3-port internal geyser, in circulation, over the solar element and returned to the internal geyser. Tiled or corrugated roofs work fine, while flat concrete roofs are ideal. The system is mounted onto the roof with each leg bolted to the beams within. Water proofing by means of flashing and sealants is accomplished relatively easily, because the panels are relatively light.</p>
<h3 id="item9">Do the glass tubes break very easily?</h3>
<p>According to South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) testing, the vacuum tubes resist hail up to 35mm in diameter. This is the largest hailstone that the SABS tests with! They might break as often as the windows in your home i.e. not very often! Should a vacuum tube break, the system continues to operate without interruption. An optional polycarbonate cover can be installed in heavy hail regions or where baboons are in the area. Replacement of a vacuum tube costs roughly R 220.00.</p>
<h3 id="item10">Can the solar geysers handle urban water pressure?</h3>
<p>Yes! Up to 400 kPa (4 Bar).</p>
<h3 id="item11">What is a 3-port geyser?</h3>
<p>Most geysers currently manufactured by ordinary geyser manufacturers have three ports. One port is taken up by the temperature/pressure (T/P) safety valve and cannot be used thereafter. Solar water heating systems require the geyser to have one additional water outlet to allow them to be easily coupled together. This makes a 4-port geyser. The Cobra geyser solves the problem by way of a Banjo type t/p safety valve which also acts as an outlet.</p>
<h3 id="item12">Why is vacuum tube technology more suited to moderate climes like the coast as opposed to flat plate technology?</h3>
<p>Flat plate collectors are susceptible to “wind Chill” which affects their efficiency. In addition to this, flat plate collectors are only efficient at solar noon when the sun is perpendicular to the collector. In contrast vacuum tubes are round, and all panels are installed with a reflector which enables them to track the sun, focusing all light on to the copper tube within the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>As well as this, vacuum tube technology is much less expensive in terms of maintenance and repair.</p>
<h3 id="item13">What is Eskom’s involvement in the solar water heating programme?</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the growing demand for electricity, Eskom is embarking on energy efficiency and alternative energy programmes that promote energy savings on a large scale in order to mitigate system constraints. Eskom is working towards a goal to meet government’s target of 10 000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy generation by 2013.</p>
<h3 id="item14">How does the programme work?</h3>
<p>The programme is structured around a rebate which reduces the selling price of a SABS approved solar water heating system. The reduction in price is based primarily on the performance of the solar water heater and its associated electricity saving potential. You receive a rebate directly from Deloittes, the facilitating auditors of the programme.</p>
<p>Only registered products, complying with the following criteria, qualify for the rebate:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>It must be a high-pressure system with pressure higher than 100kPa.</li>
<li>The system must have a timer to optimise energy savings and regulate everyday usage. Alternatively, a load management device, i.e. a geyser buddy or ripple relay, to control the usage in crisis situations must be installed.</li>
<li>The system must be appropriate for the household and area in which it is installed, in terms of size, frost protection and water quality compatibility.</li>
<li>It must have a comprehensive guarantee of at least five years.</li>
<li>The system must have passed the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) tests, and comply with the South African National Standards (SANS) for thermal and mechanical performance and safety.</li>
<li>The supplier of the system must be registered with SESSA (Sustainable Energy Society of South Africa) solar water heating division.</li>
<li>The system must be installed by a registered installer and the customer will only be able to claim the rebate once facilitating auditors receive a final invoice from their supplier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="item15">How do I ensure the quality of the system I have purchased?</h3>
<p>Purchasing a system that is registered on the Eskom programme ensures that the system and the supplier have been checked and audited, not only safeguarding you as a consumer but also giving you greater assurance of the system’s quality. Buying an Eskom registered system means you qualify for a rebate, making your purchase good value for money.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/home%20solar%20panel%20system%20diagram.jpg" alt="home solar panel system" border="0" data-lazy-loaded="true" />Many people believe that home solar power systems will eventually replace fossil-fuel based energy sources as the way that most people power their homes. This free and never-ending way to create energy is a much better way to create power for your home, and is more affordable than ever.</p>
<p>So, what is the most important thing that you should know about home solar power systems?</p>
<p>Did you know that the amount of energy that is absorbed into the earth, ocean and atmosphere every hour is more than the entire amount of energy that mankind used in the entire year of 2002. That’s what MIT’s publication “Powering the Planet: Chemical Challenges in Solar Energy Utilization” states. The earth absorbs energy from the sun in the form of heat and light, and the advent of home solar power systems means that the average citizen and homeowner can now put that energy to use!</p>
<p>That said, the most important thing you need to know about home solar power systems is that you can continue making electricity as long as the sun keeps on shining. Even if everyone had one of these amazing systems, you wouldn’t run out of energy. These systems are now available to homeowners in the form of photovoltaic solar cells, which convert sun energy into electricity and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-geyser-faq">solar geysers</a> that transfer the sun’s energy directly to water, making it hot enough for ordinary home use. The solar cells that most people use for their home solar power systems are arranged into a solar panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar panels need to be installed in different ways according to the area in which they are located. Placing solar panels in an area where they will get the most sun exposure and angling them so that they get the best exposure will allow you to get the most energy from them. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimum orientation of solar panels</a> depends on which hemisphere you are in and on the season of the year.</p>
<p>Solar powered systems can both heat the home and provide electricity for the home. You can even use them to heat your swimming pool!</p>
<p>Solar Panels have so many advantages, and so few disadvantages. Using any other sources of energy will seem like a poor choice. Here are the main advantages and disadvantages of solar power:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Solar Energy</strong></p>
<p>Saves you money</p>
<ul>
<li>After recouping the initial investment the energy is practically free.</li>
<li>The payback period will be shorter the more energy you use.</li>
<li>If you produce more energy than you use your utility company can buy the extra electricity from you, this is called net metering.</li>
<li>Solar enery is not affected by the supply and demand for oil and therefore not subject to the ever increasing price of petrol.</li>
<li>The saving will last for many years as solar panels are very durable and have a long lifespan of 20 – 30 years.</li>
<li>Solar energy indirectly reduces health costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmentally friendly</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar energy is clean, renewable (unlike gas, oil and coal) and sustainable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Solar panels do not release carbon dioxide or other gases into the air.</li>
<li>Actively contributes to the decrease of green house emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independant/semi-independant</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be utilized to offset utility-supplied energy consumption.</li>
<li>Can operate entirely independent, not requiring a connection to a power or gas grid at all.</li>
<li>Solar Energy supports local job and wealth creation, fuelling local economies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low maintenance</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar energy systems are virtually maintenance free and will last for decades.</li>
<li>Once installed, there are no recurring costs.</li>
<li>They operate silently, have no moving parts, do not release offensive smells and do not require you to add any fuel.</li>
<li>More solar panels can easily be added in the future when your family’s needs grow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Solar Energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The initial cost is the main disadvantage of installing a solar energy system.</li>
<li>The cost is still higher than utility supplied electricity but as fosil feul preices rise it is becoming more competitive.</li>
<li>Solar panels require quite a large area for installation to achieve a good level of efficiency.</li>
<li>The production of solar energy is influenced by the presence of clouds or pollution in the air.</li>
<li>No solar energy is produced at night but this problem can is solved by using batteries.</li>
<li>As far as solar powered cars go – their slower speed might not appeal to everyone caught up in today’s rat race.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, why haven’t more people been using solar systems? Especially now, in a world where our climate is rapidly changing, and our environment is more polluted than ever, and fossil fuels are starting to cost an arm and a leg?</p>
<p>Most people are nervous about not getting enough sunshine. If the sun’s not out, then the solar panels can’t collect energy. It’s not always sunny. And, even though fossil fuels have gotten a lot more expensive in recent years, these fuels are still less expensive than solar power.</p>
<p>And last of all, if you do live in a very sunny area, then you might even be able to use your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135221/http://www.alternative-energy-geek.com/why-is-solar-energy-important.html">home solar power</a> systems to make excess energy, which you can then sell back to your power company since you won’t be able to use it.</p>
<p>Every day, the benefits of solar power systems for the home are getting more and more obvious. Our society is becoming more and more energy conscious. Even though fossil fuels are still available, solar power is available as long as the sun is out, and the production of it cannot be controlled by companies or the government.</p>
<p>Solar power systems for the home are an energy source that is environmentally friendly, and will eventually be less expensive as more people start wanting to use it. Whereas fossil fuels will only get more expensive so long as people continue buying it. These home systems can save you tons of money when it comes to conditioning your home’s air.</p>
<p>There are even tax breaks in a few states or countries for people who have such systems for their homes. These tax breaks alone can make it easier for you to afford a system for your home.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the amazing new solar technology available to you today by installing a solar power system in your home. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

Posted on November 13, 2017 by root<br />
Solar Panels For Sale In South Africa</p>
<p>This is a guide to the different types of solar panels and cells available in South Africa. A price list has also been provided.<br />
Types Of Solar Panels</p>
<p>Mono-crystalline Solar Panels</p>
<p>Mono-crystalline Solar Panels are very efficient, even in low-light conditions, because they are made of one large crystal of silicon. They are not common as they are more expensive than Poly-crystalline Solar Panels to manufacture. Mono-crystalline Solar Panels can be ground-mounted or roof-mounted.<br />
Poly-crystalline Solar Panels</p>
<p>Poly-crystalline Solar Panels are not quite as efficient as Mono-crystalline Solar Panels, but are the most common type because they are less expensive to manufacture. They are made of many small silicon crystals. Poly-crystalline Solar Panels can be ground-mounted or roof-mounted.<br />
Amorphous or Thin-Film Solar Panels</p>
<p>Amorphous Solar Panels are less efficient than the above two types, therefore they require a larger surface area for the same level of power generation. However they are the cheapest to manufacture. They are made of a thin film of molten silicon that is spread across large plates of stainless steel.</p>
<p>A great advantage of Amorphous Solar Panels over the above two is that they continue to charge when only part of the solar panel receives sun.</p>
<p>They work better in hot climates than traditional solar panels and work well on large vehicles and ships.</p>
<p>Mounting Of Solar Panels</p>
<p>Ground-Mounted Solar Panels</p>
<p>Ground mounted solar panels are attached to poles that should be cemented into the ground, especially if you live in a region that has strong wind.<br />
Roof-Mounted Solar Panels</p>
<p>It is easiest to install roof-mounted solar panels on a shingle roof, though it is possible on many different types of roof.<br />
Glued To The Surface</p>
<p>Thin-film Solar Panels require no drilling as they are glued onto the roof or other flat surface, e.g. on ships. You might also consider Thin-film Solar Panels if the strength of the roof is suspect, because they are much lighter than the other types of solar panels.</p>
<p>Factors To Consider When Choosing Solar Panels</p>
<p>Roof-mounted solar panels are an option in the case of a strong roof that slopes towards the sun. Roof-mounting is possible on many types of roof, but easiest on shingle roofs. If you have weak roof, look at ground-mounting your panels or apply thin-film panels. If the roof does not face the sun you will have to look at ground-mounting your solar panels.</p>
<p>If do not wish to drill holes in your roof, then you will have to go for Ground-mounted solar panels or Thin-film Solar Panels. Thin-film solar panels need a larger roof area for the same output.</p>
<p>For an easy installation, choose Thin-film Solar Panels because they are simply glued onto the roof. The other types are not difficult to install, but do require more effort than simply gluing. The technically-minded person can do a DIY installation.</p>
<p>Here is a table to help you choose the correct type of solar panel for your situation:<br />
Strong Roof Weak Roof Large Roof Roof Not Facing The Sun Not Willing To Drill Through The Roof Limited Direct Sun Easy Installation<br />
Ground-Mounted N/A Yes N/A Yes Yes<br />
Roof-Mounted Yes No Yes No No<br />
Glued (Thin-Film) Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes<br />
What Do Solar Panels Cost?</p>
<p>There is a wide range of solar power panels at various prices and some suppliers offer regular discounts to encourage you to make the decision to buy.</p>
<p>You can expect to pay about R24 per watt for Poly-crystalline Solar Panels.</p>
<p>Solaire’s Poly-crystalline Solar Panels are believed to be the most efficient modules in the world, meaning that they provide the highest number of watts per square metre (Wp/sqm). High yield modules output at least 130 Wp/sqm in a prime position. Solaire has captured 90% of the Solar Panel world market and their panels have a life expectancy of over 30 years.</p>
<p>Thin-film Solar Panels produce about 74 Wp/sqm (peak power).</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what solar panels cost, I have included the prices of Solaire Poly-Crystalline Solar Panels from www.sustainable.co.za Check for price changes on their site.<br />
Short On Roof Space?</p>
<p>If you are critically short on roof space, you should look at the “Peak Power In Watts Per Sqm” column in this table. This suggests that you should avoid the solar panels with a low Power Per Square Metre Figure (shown in red) and buy the solar panels with a high figure (shown in green). Of course, you would also have to consider the how many panels are required to make up the required voltage.</p>
<p>After investigation you may find a similar anomaly with the solar panels of other manufacturers.<br />

Types of Solar Panel<br />
Posted on November 13, 2017 by root<br />
Solar Panels: Different Types, Electricity Storage and Cost<br />
Types of electric solar panels</p>
<p>Solar panels are made up of varying numbers of solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, which convert the sun’s energy into storable electricity by means of semiconductors, using the photovoltaic effect.  These solar panels are generally called photovoltaic (PV) panels as opposed to thermal solar panels that produce hot water. Various different types of photovoltaic solar panels are available, the most common of which are rigid, and are known as crystalline silicon, either monocrystalline or multicrystalline.  A more recent development is thin-film solar panels, which can be either rigid or flexible.  They are typically more efficient, in other words they produce more electricity for the same amount of sunshine and area of solar panel, but at present they cost more than crystalline silicon panels in South Africa.  Various sizes of solar panels are available, so when buying them it is best to work out the approximate amount of electricity required and choose the size accordingly.<br />

<p>Electricity storage (Batteries)</p>
<p>The electricity produced during the day, if not used immediately, is stored in rechargeable batteries for use when the panel is not producing electricity, such as at night or during heavily overcast weather.  The batteries used depend on requirements; it is important to calculate maximum charge and discharge rates, as well as the quantity of electricity required, before selecting batteries.  The batteries most commonly used are of the lead-acid type.  Shallow cycle lead-acid batteries, such as those used in cars, are not recommended for solar power systems, since they do not tolerate repeated heavy discharging, and are quickly damaged in these conditions.  There are several types of deep cycle batteries, such as flooded, gel and absorbed glass mat (AGM).  Each of these has different advantages and disadvantages, such as durability and lifespan, the level of maintenance required, whether or not they produce gas during operation, and of course price.<br />
Prices of solar panels in South Africa</p>
<p>The price of solar panels in South Africa depends very much on the amount of electricity required, the type and make of panel, and various other factors such as how the panel is to be mounted or integrated into a building.  Some stockists display prices online while others only provide quotes on request.  For an idea of prices in South Africa, Sustainable.co.za, which regularly features special offers and discounts and sells a wide range of sizes and types of panels, is selling their smallest rigid panel (10W) for R350 (prices correct as of 9 February 2011).  Their biggest rigid panel (250W) costs R8 850, and their biggest flexible solar panel (136W), which is recommended for camping, costs R9 990.  A full camping kit including the latter panel and all necessary peripherals costs R12 340.  They also sell rigid panel kits, including batteries, a charge controller, which protects the batteries from over charging and excessive discharging, and an inverter, which converts the DC power stored in the batteries to AC power.  A kit containing a 120W panel costs around R9 250, while a kit that would produce 1kWh per day costs about R12 500.<br />
Where to get solar panels in South Africa</p>
<p>There are now several suppliers of solar panels in South Africa.  Among them are Sustainable.co.za, K G Electric, Sinetech, GW Store, Safrelec, The Solar Company and Gener8.  They generally import their products from overseas (although some may be assembled in South Africa), and offer a range of sustainable energy solutions, including all the peripherals required.  Most of them offer the option of DIY installation or their own installation service.  The amount of information available on their websites varies from site to site, as does the range of products they offer.  Some, such as Safrelec, may be acting more as wholesalers than retailers, geared for the construction industry rather than individual customers.  Their web addresses and more info can be found under Solar Power Companies.<br />

<p class="articleinfo"><span class="createdby"> Written by Tony Clark </span></p>
<p>If you are not connected to Mains (Grid) power, or the Mains power is unreliable, you may need to store power from your solar panels Solar PV system to use when the Mains is not available, or at night.</p>
<p>My Solar Power system has 2 separate systems. We have a Grid Connect Inverter for a 1KWp solar PV array and we have a Stand Alone power system, which comprises a 3.6KWp solar array, a MPPT battery charger, a large battery bank and an inverter to power our 240V appliances. I will include photographs of our system at a later date.</p>
<p>We have a power source selection switch to allow us to control the source of our 240V Power. We can either select Mains (Grid) power or we can select Inverter (Solar) power.</p>
<p>The switch also has an OFF position between these two sources.</p>
<p>Most of the time we use Solar PV power from the Inverter, but when we do not have adequate sunshine, or our usage is high, we select the Mains power source.</p>
<p><strong>This article concentrates on the different batteries available for Solar Power storage.</strong></p>
<h3>Batteries:</h3>
<p>There are 3 main types of batteries used for Solar PV Power storage;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead – Acid</li>
<li>Nickel Cadmium  (NiCd)</li>
<li>Nickel – Iron (NiFe)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery">Lead – Acid</a></h2>
<p>These are the most commonly used storage batteries for Solar PV Storage, due mainly to their relatively low price.</p>
<p>Lead – Acid batteries can have a long service life of between 15 and 25 years in Float applications and between 5 and 10 years in solar applications. Their “self-discharge is low at about 40% per annum. The lead in these batteries is recyclable, but lead is a toxic metal, so end of life recycling is important.</p>
<p>There are 3 technologies available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vented (Flooded) Cells – These have liquid electrolyte in them. This then has the risk of leakage or spills from the battery. Vented cells are suitable for use in high temperature locations, and in Solar applications have additional electrolyte capacity to cater for regular (automatic) equalisation charges. They also require regular maintenance (checking electrolyte levels, cleaning terminals, recording cell voltage and Specific Gravity.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery#Gel_battery">Gel Cells (Sealed Lead Acid &#8211; SLA)</a> – These overcome the risks of electrolyte leakage by having the electrolyte in a gel form.  These batteries have a relatively long life and most manufacturers have overcome terminal corrosion issues. They are lighter than equivalent capacity vented cells. They batteries are suitable for moderately high temperature locations as there is adequate electrolyte.  Some manufacturers produce GEL cells specifically for Solar power applications. These batteries will have a maximum cell voltage specified by the manufacturer.  Operation above this voltage will cause excessive “gassing” and this may cause the pressure valve to vent pressure (gasses from the electrolyte) which will reduce the available electrolyte.  Regular maintenance should include measuring cell voltages and temperature.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery#Absorbed_glass_mat">AGM Cells (Sealed Lead Acid &#8211; SLA) </a> – These cells have an absorbent glass mat to hold the electrolyte. These are usually the cheapest type of Lead – Acid battery.  They are very light compared with Vented or Gel cells, as they do not have the large volume of electrolyte used in Vented or Gel cells. As there is little excess electrolyte operation in high temperature areas is not recommended.  These also have a maximum cell voltage specified and operation above this voltage will shorten battery life significantly.  These are not recommended for use in “charge / discharge” applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery_%28vented_cell_type%29#Sealed_vs._vented">Nickel Cadmium</a></h2>
<p>These have a long life but have a high initial cost and are not as efficient in storing power than Lead–Acid. Nickel – Cadmium (NiCd) batteries are available as vented or sealed varieties. They have a higher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy density</a> than Lead Acid batteries, are smaller, longer lived and have lower maintenance needs but they are less efficient (losing up to 40% of power in a charge / discharge cycle) and have a high self discharge rate (up to 120% per annum). At “end of life” these batteries must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner to prevent contamination of the environment with the Cadmium they contain.  NiCd battery disposal costs can be high. The high purchase price and high disposal cost are real disincentives to the use of NiCd cells in solar Systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134247/http://www.nickel-iron-battery.com/">Nickel Iron</a></h2>
<p>Nickel Iron batteries have the longest life of the 3 technologies discussed. They contain no environmentally damaging metals and perform well in deep cycle operation. They have a relatively high charge – discharge efficiency (approaching 100% at 50% Charged), but relatively low charge retention, losing 20% – 30% of capacity per month. The main disincentive to NiFe cell use in solar Systems, is the high purchase price.</p>
<p>Here is a Table Comparing these 3 battery types (Based on information from Wikipedia)</p>

<p class="articleinfo"><span class="createdby"> Written by Tony Clark </span></p>
<h2>The Start</h2>
<p>In 2000, my wife and I sold our home and purchased another, in a different suburb.  At our new home, my wife wanted to install a swimming pool; I wanted to install Solar panels and a Grid Connect Inverter.  We both ended up having what we wanted, although I ended up being the one to clean the pool.</p>
<p>We installed a 1500Wp system on the roof of the garage, which comprised 15 100Wp Shell solar panels and a Selectronic SEAG 1500 inverter.  The solar panels were installed on a frame, which allowed them to be elevated in winter, and lowered for summer, to maximize power generation during those seasons.</p>
<p>This was very reliable, even surviving a thunderstorm, which destroyed the power meter at our house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Relocation</h2>
<p>In 2006, we changed homes again, buying a “solar oriented” rammed earth home.  An environmental engineer built this house in 1984.</p>
<p>The buyers of our previous home did not want to pay extra for the solar power system, so I removed it an reinstalled the solar panels at our new home.</p>
<p>I retained the ability to elevate and lower the panels to maximize seasonal power generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stand alone Solar Power</h2>
<p>I was unable to get the Grid connect inverter working satisfactorily, and we were on a “spur line” which had no alternate route for the power feed, so I decided to build a stand alone power system, using second hand flooded batteries, rated at 600AH over 10 hours, from a telecommunications site.  These batteries were already 15 years old, but should still have some life left in them for this application.</p>
<p>I installed the batteries in 2 rows in our garage (a double width garage) but with the batteries in place, there was only room for one vehicle (my wife’s).</p>
<p>I purchased an Outback MX-60 MPPT battery charger to manage the power from the solar panels and charge the 48V battery bank.  This allowed me to retain the previous configuration of the solar array as 3 series panel strings (5 in parallel).  The Maximum Power point for this array was approximately 90V (dependant on solar insolation, temperature and time of day).</p>
<p>I also purchased a Selectronics SX 42 inverter and current shunts to allow its “state of charge” function to provide this information to us.  This allowed us to draw up to 4.2KW for up to 30 minutes before it would de-rate to 3.6KW output.  When my wife used the Clothes drier and the electric kettle (2.5KW) at the same time, it shut down due to overload. My wife has adjusted to using the kettle on the gas cooker for heating water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-solar powered loads</h2>
<p>As our home has 3-phase power connected and we use 3 phase power for water pumps for drinking water and for garden water (from a bore hole), we decided to retain the mains for these pumps, the oven, air conditioner and for the solar hot water booster element. As we have a wood fuelled heating fire fitted with a “wet back” to provide water heating during winter, electric boosting is not used at all.</p>
<p>I devised a switching system, where all phases were connected to the AC Distribution in our house when the switch is set to “Mains Power”, but selected loads are connected to the inverter source, when the switch is set to “Solar Inverter”.  An “Off” position is used between these, to prevent connection of the mains to the inverter output (this would destroy the inverter as it is not rated for mains connection).</p>
<p>Our neighbour is a licensed electrical contractor who specializes in industrial electrical contracting, but he was interested in my project, so he offered to wire up the inverter and switches.</p>
<p>The 1.5KWp solar array was not able to supply our daily power usage, so I have added solar panels in 2 stages over 3 years, to bring the total stand alone capacity to 3.6KWp.  This easily provides between 10 and 14 KWH to our battery bank on clear days, even in winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>On clear days, at any time of year, this system provides more than enough power for our usage. Where a cloudy day is followed by clear days, the battery capacity is recovered within 2 or 3 days of fine weather.  Where there are 2 or 3 cloudy days in a row, we switch to Mains during the “Off Peak” periods of the Time of Use metering scheme, to minimise the cost of power used.</p>
<p>If there are 4 or more cloudy days following each other, we switch to “Solar Inverter”, only for “Peak” periods, of the Time of Use metering scheme. In this way we can avoid the high cost power periods, even when the solar power is not generating enough power for our needs.</p>
<p>Where mains power is not available due to network faults and t clouds prevent solar charging of the battery, we can connect a single-phase generator and switch to that in place of the Solar Inverter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Battery Capacity</h2>
<p>The battery voltage depends on the number of 2V cells in series, which make up the battery. 24 cells in series make a nominal 48V battery (operating voltage between 47V under load at less than 50% charged and 60V when nearly fully charged (absorb mode of MX-60).  By adding one more cell, the nominal battery voltage changed to between 49V and 62.5V, which is still within specification for the inverter we have.  This provides and additional 4% battery capacity.</p>
<p>I have sourced more of the used telecommunications batteries and built a 2-tier stand to support them in the same floor space as 24 cells occupy.  When complete, the additional batteries will provide a total of 56 KWH of energy storage.  I try to minimise battery discharges greater than 50% of battery capacity, so at 50% discharge this would provide about 4 days of supply to our home (even more if we further limit usage).</p>
<p>A few of these cells have failed in the 4 years we have had the first bank in use.  Fortunately I was able to remove one cell, (bringing the battery back to 48V nominal) until a replacement cell was obtained.  Luckily, we have not had 2 cells fail concurrently and my supplier of used cells has been able to provide them at short notice.  His supply is becoming harder to obtain as most telecommunications providers are now using Sealed Lead Acid batteries in preference to flooded cells.  I plan to stockpile a few flooded cells, setting them up as a 12V battery in my workshop, charged by a small solar array and MPPT charger.  Faulty cells in the main battery will then be more readily replaced and I will have a much longer time period to source replacements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Battery Replacement Plan</h2>
<p>As most of our power is sourced from the Solar System, I have decided to set aside the amount that we would otherwise pay for power, as a reserve for eventual battery replacement.  When my source of flooded cells is no longer available, I will purchase new replacement cells (perhaps 5 at a time) to upgrade the battery banks.  These cells cost over Au$700 each, but we would spend over $2000 annually for mains power, without the solar system, so we should easily be able to replace up to 5 cells each 2 years. 10 years for one whole battery bank. 10 years battery life is achievable and with the second battery bank, longer battery life is possible (discharges below 50% capacity occur less often would result in longer battery life).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Our Grid Connect Solar System</strong></h2>
<p>Three years ago the Australian government was offering significant rebates for the installation of grid connected solar power systems and the Western Australian Government was offering a Feed–in Tariff of 40 cents per KW fed to the Grid.  We signed up for a 1KWp system and paid only $1500 for it, complete, installed and commissioned.  This now offsets our mains power usage for pumps, oven and air conditioning.  Our power bill is now between Au$50 in credit or debt, depending on cloud cover during the 2-month billing period.</p>
<p>When the Feed-in Tariff expires (politicians decide to stop it), I can connect the Grid connect solar panels to the Stand Alone system.  I believe that we will then be able to use the oven and air conditioner on the Stand Alone power system. I would still need to have Mains power for the pumps, but the main heavy loads would be running from our solar power system.</p>

<p class="articleinfo"><span class="createdby"> Written by Simisha Pather-Elias </span> <span class="createdate"> Tuesday, 23 August 2011 21:14 </span></p>
<p>2011 has indeed been an interesting year for the renewable energy sector in the country. Electricity tariffs went up another 25% in July making all renewable energy technologies more attractive to the consumer, especially solar water heaters (SWHs); and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.energy.gov.za/IRP/irp%20files/IRP2010_2030_Final_Report_20110325.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated Resource Plan 2</a> (IRP2)<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> was finalized with big wins for the solar industry especially  for large scale solar PV. Following that, the government announced the reduction in rebates for solar water heaters and declared the feed-in tariff model (REFIT) to be illegal, sending renewable energy investors and developers scuttling.  With this rollercoaster chain of events, one ponders where the solar industry is going and whether it is the right time for companies to invest in South Africa.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, the major obstacle to advancement of the solar industry in South Africa, has always been the high cost of the technology. While international learning curves have reduced the cost of renewable energy technologies significantly, most technologies remain prohibitive unless there are incentives such as subsidies and rebates. This has been the case for solar water heaters and solar PV in particular.</p>
<h2>Solar Water Heaters</h2>
<p>The solar water heaters market has flourished with the number of suppliers increasing more than 20-fold in the last decade to approximately 400<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/press-release.pag?docid=226282192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>, 2011) – this in line with the government’s subsidy scheme for domestic users. Although the subsidy which has fulfilled its purpose to kick start the market is now coming to an end, the country’s target for 1 million solar by 2014 still remains. Furthermore, with electricity costs going up another 25% next year, the impending of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/including-solar-water-heaters-in-building-codes-to-help-sa-reach-2014-target-2011-06-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green building codes</a> for all buildings<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"></a>, and the possible pass over costs of the proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.polity.org.za/article/eskom-warns-it-will-pass-on-full-carbon-tax-effect-to-consumers-2011-06-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon taxes from Eskom to the consumer</a><a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"></a>, the solar water heaters used in households is forecasted to remain strong. A large growth spurt in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.reafrica.co.za/Images/Presentations%20Day%202/Dominic%20Goncalves.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solar water heater industry</a> from 2012 onwards until maturity in 2016 is expected<a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"></a>.</p>
<p>Those companies which can secure their place in the market now, using quality products and workmanship will reap the benefits in the years to come. Government has also proposed subsidies for local manufacturers, an opportunity for South Africato become an exporter of green technologies.  What remains is knowledge dissemination and skills exchange to increase the number of technicians, especially plumbers and electricians who can install different types of solar water heaters to meet the projected demand.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/ewh%20market.jpg" alt="South Africa solar industry - Development, growth, maturity" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Solar PV (Photovoltaic)</h2>
<p>Following the solar water heater industry is solar PV, which although still very much in its infancy, is expected to explode beyond its current off-grid use which includes telecommunications, game farms and isolated lodges, rural applications and navigational buoys. While experimental road signage, street lights and billboard illumination has started to take off recently, the price of PV remains uneconomical and government support is largely needed to stimulate this market.</p>
<p>The IRP2 has a target of 8 400MW by 2030, with 300MW planned for installment annually from 2012 for large scale PV – a welcomed surprise considering the price of the solar modules.  While the current price of PV modules has decreased significantly, and the PV manufacturing industry continues to grow, even in the absence of the 5GW Upington Solar Project (comprising both Concentrated Solar Power and solar PV), the potential for an export orientated manufacturing hub in South Africais a key growth area. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?Src=RSS&amp;docid=232973392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report by Frost and Sullivan</a><a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410135024/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> states that &#8220;several global leading manufacturers are currently expressing interest in developing large-scale manufacturing facilities in South Africa&#8221;, allowing South Africa to attain growth revenues of $29.8 million by 2014. When the plans for the solar park are confirmed, this will propel South Africa’s manufacturing hub even further. Other industries that will also clearly benefit are sales and distribution, and construction, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>It’s a very exciting time for the solar industry in South Africa. The opportunity of a green economy is exactly what South Africa requires to put itself into the forefront of the renewable energy sector, despite the prevailing globally failing markets and the unnerving global economic outlook.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span itemprop="description"><h1 class="contentheading"><a class="contentpagetitle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-pool-heating"> Heat Your Pool with Solar Power</a></h1>
<p>Solar water heating has been around for some time, it was practised and accepted around the world in countries such as China, Australia, Greece, Turkey, Israel and Japan. It has until recently been too expensive for the average South African consumer – but not anymore.</p>
<p>More and more South African families are switching over to solar water heating as a viable alternative to the traditional warm water cylinder. Solar water heaters are cost and energy effective, and will deliver an optimum amount of hot water throughout most of the year.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/solar-pool-heating-panels.jpg" alt="Solar panels for pool heating" />Although solar water heating has been successfully introduced into South Africa, it is still not being optimally utilised. When you say “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/solar-thermal-hot-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solar water heating</a>”, most people think hot water for shower and bathing &#8211; but what else can we use this for? Heating your swimming pool for one! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713/http://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/PoolHeating/pool_heating.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solar pool heating</a> is easier than you think and a great application for solar power.</p>
<p>The systems available are simple and very user friendly &#8211; they are also relatively inexpensive. Most pools use simple, low cost, un-glazed plastic solar collectors.  Un-glazed, meaning not covered in a glass casing or other glazed product. Your pool itself becomes the thermal storage for your system, you actually utilize the same pump you use to filter your pool water to circulate water through your solar collectors.</p>
<p>The solar collectors works on very simple principles and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials. It mainly consists of most of the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>The Solar Collector</li>
<li>The Filter</li>
<li>The Pump</li>
<li>The Flow Control Valve</li>
</ul>
<p>Each component has it specific task, The Solar Collector does exactly what its name suggests &#8211; it is a devise through which the pool water is circulated to be heated by the sun. The Filter &#8211; like in your pool &#8211; removes debris from the water before it is pumped through the collectors. The Pump circulates the water in the pool and through the filter and then trough the collectors, and finally back into the pool to start the whole process over again. The Flow Control Valve is an essential component to the collector as it is responsible for the flow of water through the solar collector, the flow control valve, is either a manual or automatic device &#8211; depending on what system you have.</p>
<p>So to sum up, the water is pumped through the filter, and then through the solar collector(s), where it is heated and returned back to the pool. A little known fact is that in hotter climates your solar collector can be used to cool your pool water. It does that by circulating the water through the Solar Collectors at night.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713im_/https://benjanow.github.io/SolarHomes/images/diy-solar-panels.jpg" alt="DIY Solar panels for heating your pool" />Solar pool collectors are made of a variety of materials. The type you need will be determined by the climate where you live and how you intend to use your Solar Pool Collector. If you plan to use your pool in temperatures above freezing &#8211; then you most likely only need an un-glazed collector system. Un-glazed collectors are, generally made out of heavy duty rubber or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UV</a> treated plastic. The plastic is treated with this UV resistant coating to help prolong the life of the heating panels in the collector. Un-glazed Collectors are usually inexpensive due to their simple design and cost effective parts. Un-glazed systems may even be more cost effective than glazed collector systems. The reason being that the Glazed collectors are generally made with copper tubing or aluminium plate. These metal components are then placed in a tempered glass covering &#8211; and this is where the real cost come in. Glazed Collectors, do however capture solar heat better in colder climates. They can basically be used all year round, in any climate.</p>
<p>You can quite easily build a solar pool heater yourself. Many South Africans are doing this because it is so cheap and easy to do. If you feel like building your own pool heater read this guide on how to build a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195713/http://www.solar-for-energy.com/homemade-solar-pool-heater.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home-made solar pool heater</a>.</p>
<p>Installing a solar pool heater pays for itself within its first year to year and a half. They do typically last longer than gas and heated pump pool heaters. If installed properly by a professional, and with regular maintenance, your Solar Pool Heating System should run smoothly and effortlessly for the next 10 &#8211; 20 years.</p>
